## AIMS Project

*Adapting and Implementing Innovative Material in Statistics* (AIMS) was an NSF-funded project from 2006&ndash;2010 that developed lesson plans and activities based on innovative materials that have been produced for introductory statistics courses (DUE-0535912). Initially written in 2005&ndash;2006, the AIMS lesson plans and student activity guides were developed to help transform an introductory statistics course into one that is aligned with the [Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE)](http://www.amstat.org/education/gaise/) for teaching introductory statistics courses. The lessons, which build on implications from educational research, involve students in small and large group discussion, computer explorations, and hands-on activities. The lessons are described in full detail along with the research foundations for the lessons, in Garfield and Ben-Zvi's book [Developing Students' Statistical Reasoning: Connecting Research and Teaching Practice](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781402083822).

- The AIMS materials are available on Github at https://github.com/zief0002/aims

## BioSQuaRE Project


*Biology Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam* (BioSQuaRE) was a multi-institutional HHMI-funded project from 2013&ndash;2016 that developed an instrument to assess the quantitative readiness of students planning on majoring in biology or the life sciences (Grant #520076788).

## CATALST Project

*Change Agents for Teaching and Learning Statistics* (CATALST) was an NSF-funded project from 2008&ndash;2012 that developed materials for teaching a radically different introductory statistics course based on randomization and bootstrap methods to provide students a deep understanding of statistical inference (DUE-0814433). The materials 
produced from this project include a set of in-class activities and an online-book of accompanying reading material.

- The online book, *Statistical Thinking: A Simulation Approach to Modeling Uncertainty*, is available at http://zief0002.github.io/statistical-thinking/. 
- The data sets and PDF version of the lab manual (in-class activities) are available on Github at https://github.com/zief0002/statistical-thinking.

## e-ATLAS Project

*Evaluation and Assessment of Teaching and Learning About Statistics* (e-ATLAS) was an NSF-funded project from 2011&ndash;2013 that developed high-quality instruments to help evaluate the effectiveness of past and on-going efforts to reform the teaching and learning of introductory statistics at the tertiary level (DUE-1044812 &amp; 1043141). Two instruments developed as part of this project were the *Statistics Teaching Inventory* (STI) and *Goals and Outcomes Associated with Learning Statistics* (GOALS). An additional instrument, the *Basic Literacy in Statistics (BLIS)*, was developed by Laura Ziegler as part of her doctoral dissertation research was also a part of the e-ATLAS project.

- More information about the STI, including the instrument itself, can be found at https://zief0002.github.io/sti/
